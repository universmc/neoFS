Okay, let's break down how to use the `express` nodule in Node.js.  

**What is Express.js?**

Express.js is a minimalist and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web servers and APIs, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

**Getting Started**

1. **Installation:**

   ```bash
   npm install express 
   ```

2. **Basic Structure:**

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const port = 3000;

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello World!');
   });

   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);
   });
   ```

   * **Explanation:**
     * We require the `express` module.
     * We create an `express` application instance (`app`).
     * We define a route (`/`) that handles GET requests. When a user visits the root URL, it sends back "Hello World!".
     * We start the server on port 3000 and log a message to the console.

3. **Running the Server:**

   ```bash
   node your_file_name.js
   ```

   Replace `your_file_name.js` with the actual name of your file.

**Key Features of Express.js**

* **Routing:** Define different routes for different URLs and handle requests accordingly.
* **Middleware:** Use middleware functions to modify requests and responses, perform tasks like authentication, logging, or data parsing.
* **Templating Engines:** Integrate with templating engines (e.g., EJS, Pug, Handlebars) to generate dynamic HTML content.
* **Static File Serving:** Serve static files (images, CSS, JavaScript) from a designated directory.
* **Error Handling:**  Establish error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage unexpected situations.
* **Body Parsing:**  Parse incoming request bodies (e.g., JSON, form data) for processing.
